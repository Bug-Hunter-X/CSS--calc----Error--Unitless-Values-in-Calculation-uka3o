The corrected CSS code with explicit units is:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 100px);
  /* Or other appropriate unit like em, rem, etc. */
}
```

By including the unit (`px` in this example), the `calc()` function can correctly perform the calculation.  Using consistent units for each operand is crucial. Ensure all your units in the calculation are compatible; for example, do not mix pixels and percentages directly without proper conversion.
