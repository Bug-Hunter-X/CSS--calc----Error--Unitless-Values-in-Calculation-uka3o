The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `calc()` function and the `unitless` values.  The `calc()` function expects its operands to have units.  If you try to use a unitless number directly with an operator, it may result in unexpected behavior or an error depending on the browser.

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 100);
}
```

In this example, `100` is unitless, causing problems.  The correct way to specify a number within the `calc()` function is to explicitly add units:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 100px);
}
```
